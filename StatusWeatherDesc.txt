Status weather is the latest addition to my projects. It is a project concentrating on Android and giving the user some unique functionality such as current temperature reading in the status bar, custom notification layout showing the weather forecast for the next 3 hours. 
Additionally the user enjoys full weekly forecast as well as hourly overview for the next 48 hours.
As the project is not live yet you can get the beta from my App Center distribution. Enjoy!

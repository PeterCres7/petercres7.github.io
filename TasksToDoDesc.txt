let MyTasks = `
The project was build using Xamarin and
introduces a simple To Do application that can
store tasks locally in the device memory using 
MySQL DataBase. An interesting addition to the
application was the Notification count icon
which prove quite difficult.
The Project was done to help me get more
familiar with Xamarin as a whole as I am a 
strong believer that the better you understand
what needs to be automated the better you are
at approaching the problems that come up when 
working with the technology.
